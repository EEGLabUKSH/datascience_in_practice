# # s00: Introduction
# 
# Welcome to the hands on materials for psyM1-2 *(practical part)*.
# This notebook will guide through getting the tools you will need for data science related tasks.

# ### Prüfungsordnung
# 
# First things first, why are you here and what are you doing? A closer look in the [Prüfungsordnung](http://www.studservice.uni-kiel.de/sta/fachpruefungsordnung-psychologie-master-1-fach.pdf) shed some lights on everything.

# Another excerpt from the Prüfungsordnung: 
# 
# > Als zentrales Ziel des Masterstudiengangs sollen Voraussetzungen für das selbstständige und
# > eigenverantwortliche Arbeiten in den Berufsfeldern der Psychologie geschaffen werden. Dabei
# > werden auch Transferkompetenzen zur Verbindung wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse mit
# > **praktischen Handeln** erworben. <br>

# 
# Therefore this seminar will provide you with some hands-on tools of psychological competence with a wide variety of used cases in the real-world.

# 
# 

# ### Tools
# 
# These tutorials presume that you do already have some basic knowledge of programming. 
# 
# If you are somewhat unfamiliar with Python, we will make sure you feel comfortable with Python by the end of the seminar.
# 
# The following are a series of tools that you will need for this class
# 
# 1. Anaconda
# 2. git & GitHub Desktop
# 
# Today we will go through them and how to set them up.

# **Already have Python**?
# - If you are running code locally, we recommend you install a new version of Python with Anaconda, as described below
# - If you are on Mac, you have a native installation of python. This native installation of Python may be older, will not include the extra packages that you will need for this class, and is best left untouched. 
#     - Downloading Anaconda will install a separate, independent install of Python, leaving your native install untouched. 
# - Windows does not require Python natively and so it is not typically pre-installed.

# Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python, designed for scientific computing, data science and machine learning.

# <div class="alert alert-info">

# Anaconda itself is a distribution, meaning that is a version of Python with a collection of packages that are curated and maintained together. 
# Using a pre-built distribution is useful, as it comes with the packages that you need for data science.
# Anaconda also comes with `conda`, which is a package manager, allowing you to download, install, and manage other packages. 
# 
# <div class="alert alert-danger">
# Download and install Anaconda until the next session. (1 point)

# Git & GitHub are not the same thing, though, in practice, they are commonly used together, whereby git is used as a tool to version control code and manage multiple copies stored across your computer, as well as on remote repositories that are stored on Github.
